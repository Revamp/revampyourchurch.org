			<h3><strong> Purpose </strong></h3>
			<p>We at Project Revamp believe the youth of today, is the future of tomorrow. A future without God is not a future; therefore, we want to do everything we can to educate the future generation about the wonders of the one true God. We want to educate them about the sacrifice of Jesus and his eternal love.</p>

			<h3><strong>Method</strong></h3>
		<p>We strive to reach this generation through technology and modern tools. With educational websites, easy-to-read scripture, modern Christian music, etc.</p>
